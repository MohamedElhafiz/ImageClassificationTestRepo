- In this test you are supposed to build a classification model that is used to determine whether an image includes a crack or not.
- The file dataset.zip that resides within this repo includes images that are either positive or negative for having cracks. 
- The images are labelled using seperate directories (positive/ negative). They are also splitted into training and testing data.
- You are supposed to train/validate your model using the training set(feel free create augmented images if that helps you).
- The resutls of the model on the test set should be demonstrated using convinient metrics / visualization tools / etc . Furthermore the resutls should be discussed.
- All steps to create the model should be demonstrated and justified in any convinient way that you prefer(github repo/ colab project/etc.)
